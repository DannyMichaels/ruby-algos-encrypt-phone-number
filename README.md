## Mini Algo Hash Phone Number

### Objectives

- Storing plain text phone numbers is never a good idea! Your algorithm should hash a phone number and only display the last 4 numbers. Everything else should become a `*`, the hyphens must remain in their respective places.
- Feel free to use any methods you find useful!

> i.e.:
> input => `718-867-5309`
> output => `***-***-5309`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- `cd` into the repo directory
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` in the root of the repo to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
