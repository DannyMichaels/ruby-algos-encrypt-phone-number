## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Encrypt Phone Number"

_Language: Ruby_

_Difficulty Rating: Easy_

### Objectives

- **Storing plain text phone numbers is never a good idea!**
- Create a function which takes a phone number as a parameter (`str`) and returns an encrypted phone number which only displays the last 4 numbers.
- Encrypted numbers should become an asterisk, `*`, and the hyphens must remain in their respective places.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `718-867-5309`
>
> output => `***-***-5309`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- `cd` into the repo directory
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` in the root of the repo to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes

- The input will always be an American country code, without the `+01`.
- The input will always be a 10 digit phone number with conventional conventional dashes.

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
